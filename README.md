# Traffic Management System (TMS) ðŸš¦

An AI-powered Traffic Management System (TMS) that optimizes urban traffic flow using real-time data, computer vision, and intelligent algorithms.

## Features
âœ… **Real-time Traffic Analysis** â€“ YOLO-based object detection for vehicle and pedestrian density.  
âœ… **Dynamic Signal Control** â€“ Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS) for efficient signal timing.  
âœ… **Smart Routing** â€“ Uses Greedy BFS for optimizing bus routes.  
âœ… **Edge Computing** â€“ Runs on Raspberry Pi for on-site processing.  
âœ… **Data Storage & Analytics** â€“ Logs traffic data for predictive analysis.  
âœ… **Emergency Response** â€“ Prioritizes signals for ambulances and emergency vehicles.  

## Technology Stack
- **Computer Vision:** YOLO for object detection
- **Embedded Systems:** Raspberry Pi for edge processing
- **Algorithms:** Greedy BFS for route optimization
- **Database:** Cloud/Local storage for traffic data
